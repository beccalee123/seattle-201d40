# Class 7: Object-Oriented Programming with Constructor Functions; HTML Tables

<a id="top"></a>
## Today's Plan: Week 2, Tuesday Lecture

- [Code Review (Buildout of yesterday's lab, and let's use `live-server`!)](#codereview)

*10-minute break*

- [Constructor functions](#code)

*10-minute break*

- [HTML Tables](#tables)

- [Lab overview](#lab)

## Reminder: one-on-one meetings

- Sam will do 15-minute one-on-one meetings with each student during Weeks 2 and 4 of the course.
- The goal of the meetings is to provide an opportunity for individual feedback and for students to ask any questions they may have.
- You can book your meeting at [this link](https://sam-201d40.youcanbook.me/); be sure to make a note of your meeting time as you will not get an email reminder or otherwise be able to go back into the system and access your time slot.
- The meetings will be done in one of the little conference rooms in "The Catacombs"; just head over at your time.

## Readings

- HTML Chapter 6: "Tables"
- JS Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)

## Code Review

Maybe we should just do a quick buildout of yesterday's lab?

## Constructor Functions

We'll look at how to build constructor functions from object literals and discuss the most basic fundamentals of prototypal inheritance, a huge JS topic that we'll be seeing a lot more of in the coming weeks.

## HTML Tables

**HTML Chapter 6: "Tables"**

- p.131: Basic table structure
- p.132: Table headings
- p.133: Spanning columns & rows
- We'll also do a demo how to build HTML tables dynamically with JavaScript

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 7 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate an object literal into a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to use the ‘prototype’ property to extend the inheritable properties and methods of a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to dynamically build an HTML table with JavaScript and render it to the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
